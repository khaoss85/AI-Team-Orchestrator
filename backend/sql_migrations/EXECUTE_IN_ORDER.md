# SQL EXECUTION ORDER - DELIVERABLE SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Execute in this exact order via SQL Editor

### STEP 1: Create Required Tables First
Execute this file to create the missing tables:
```
backend/create_missing_deliverable_tables.sql
```

This creates:
- `execution_logs` table
- `asset_artifacts` table (with `name`, `type`, `metadata` columns)
- `deliverables` table (with `overall_quality_score`, `deliverable_type`, `completed_assets` columns)
- `asset_requirements` table
- All necessary indexes and triggers

### STEP 2: Create Unified Views and Stored Procedures
Execute this file to create the database-first deliverable system:
```
backend/sql_migrations/unified_deliverable_views.sql
```

This creates:
- `unified_asset_deliverable_view` - combines assets and deliverables
- `workspace_deliverable_metrics` - workspace-level metrics
- `extract_workspace_deliverable_assets()` - stored procedure for asset extraction
- `create_deliverable_from_assets()` - stored procedure for deliverable creation
- Performance indexes and triggers

## WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS

The views and stored procedures in Step 2 reference the tables created in Step 1. The error you're seeing occurs because:

```sql
-- This line in the view:
aa.name as asset_name,
-- References the 'name' column in asset_artifacts table
-- But asset_artifacts table doesn't exist yet!
```

## VERIFICATION

After executing both files, verify with:
```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('asset_artifacts', 'deliverables', 'execution_logs');

-- Check views exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.views 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE '%deliverable%';

-- Check stored procedures exist
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name LIKE '%deliverable%';
```

## EXPECTED RESULT

After both files are executed successfully:
- ✅ Task 1.6 (Deliverable System Consolidation) will be COMPLETED
- ✅ Database-first architecture replaces 6,665 lines of scattered code
- ✅ Python adapter provides 100% backward compatibility
- ✅ Performance optimized with indexes and stored procedures
- ✅ All existing imports continue to work via aliases
