- **Performance Analytics**: Workspace insight summaries and domain statistics

## Key Features

### 1. Domain-Specific Insight Storage
```python
# Store Instagram marketing insights
instagram_insight = EnhancedBusinessInsight(
    insight_title="Hashtag Mix Strategy for Higher Engagement",
    description="Combining niche and broad hashtags in 30/70 ratio increases engagement by 35%",
    domain_type="instagram_marketing",
    quantifiable_metrics={
        "engagement_rate_before": 0.02,
        "engagement_rate_after": 0.027,
        "improvement_percentage": 35
    },
    action_recommendations=[
        "Use 30% niche hashtags specific to your industry",
        "Include 70% broad hashtags with high search volume"
    ],
    business_value_score=0.85,
    confidence_score=0.90
)

insight_id = await store_domain_insight(instagram_insight)
```

### 2. Task Execution Enhancement
```python
# Get relevant insights for task execution
insights = await learning_engine.get_domain_insights_for_task(
    workspace_id="workspace_id",
    task_description="Create Instagram hashtag strategy for tech startup"
)

# Insights include:
# - Actionable recommendations
# - Quantifiable metrics

## Database Schema

### Enhanced Fields in `workspace_insights` Table
The system uses the existing `workspace_insights` table structure with enhanced metadata:

```sql
-- Core fields (existing)
id, workspace_id, task_id, agent_role, insight_type, content, 
relevance_tags, confidence_score, expires_at, created_at, updated_at, metadata

-- Enhanced metadata structure (stored in JSONB metadata field)
{
  "domain_type": "instagram_marketing",
  "insight_category": "performance_metric", 
  "domain_specific_metadata": {
    "platform": "instagram",
    "content_type": "hashtag_strategy",
    "audience_size": "10k-50k followers"
  },
  "quantifiable_metrics": {
    "engagement_rate_before": 0.02,
    "engagement_rate_after": 0.027,
    "improvement_percentage": 35
  },
  "action_recommendations": [
    "Use 30% niche hashtags specific to your industry",
    "Include 70% broad hashtags with high search volume"
  ],
  "business_value_score": 0.85,
  "quality_threshold": 0.70,
  "application_count": 0,
  "validation_status": "validated"
}
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Content-Aware Learning Engine
- Extracts business insights from deliverable content
- Classifies by domain (Instagram marketing, email marketing, etc.)
- Calculates business value and confidence scores
- Stores insights using enhanced database layer

### 2. Task Executor Integration
```python
# In executor.py (future enhancement)
from services.learning_feedback_engine import learning_feedback_engine

# Get relevant insights before task execution
insights = await learning_feedback_engine.get_domain_insights_for_task(
    workspace_id, task.description, task.task_type
)

# Inject insights into task context for AI agents
context_with_insights = {
    "task_context": task.context_data,
    "business_insights": insights,
    "recommended_actions": [r for insight in insights for r in insight["recommendations"]]
}
```

### 3. Quality Validation Pipeline
- Only learns from deliverables with quality > 0.7
- Validates business value scores before storage
- Tracks application success rates for insight refinement

## Supported Business Domains

The system currently supports 9 business domains with room for expansion:

1. **Instagram Marketing** (`instagram_marketing`)
2. **Email Marketing** (`email_marketing`) 
3. **Lead Generation** (`lead_generation`)
4. **Content Creation** (`content_creation`)
5. **Social Media** (`social_media`)
6. **Advertising** (`advertising`)
7. **Analytics** (`analytics`)
8. **Customer Engagement** (`customer_engagement`)
9. **Conversion Optimization** (`conversion_optimization`)

Each domain has specific metadata structures and quantifiable metrics relevant to that business area.

## API Usage Examples

### Store Domain Insight
```python
from services.enhanced_insight_database import store_domain_insight

insight_id = await store_domain_insight(enhanced_business_insight)
```

### Retrieve Domain Insights
```python
from services.enhanced_insight_database import get_domain_insights

insights = await get_domain_insights(
    workspace_id="workspace_id",
    domain_type="instagram_marketing",
    min_business_value=0.7
)
```

### Get High-Value Insights for Task Execution
```python
from services.enhanced_insight_database import get_high_value_insights

top_insights = await get_high_value_insights(workspace_id, top_n=5)
```

### Search Insights by Content
```python
from services.enhanced_insight_database import search_domain_insights

insights = await search_domain_insights(
    workspace_id, 
    "hashtag strategy", 
    domain="instagram_marketing"
)
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Database Schema Migration
The migration file `016_enhance_workspace_insights_for_content_learning.sql` is prepared for future deployment when direct database schema modifications are possible. This will add dedicated columns for:
- `domain_type`
- `business_value_score`
- `quantifiable_metrics` (JSONB)
- `action_recommendations` (JSONB)
- Performance tracking fields

### 2. Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
- Insight effectiveness metrics
- Domain performance comparisons
- Business value trend analysis
- Application success rates by domain

### 3. AI-Driven Insight Validation
- Automatic quality scoring for extracted insights
- Cross-validation with industry benchmarks
- Continuous learning from application outcomes

## Security and Compliance

### Data Privacy
- All insights are workspace-scoped
- No cross-workspace data leakage
- Sensitive data filtering in content analysis

### Performance Safeguards
- Rate limiting on insight generation
- Quality thresholds prevent low-value storage
- Application tracking prevents insight spam

## Success Metrics

The Content-Aware Learning System database integration successfully demonstrates:

- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles multiple business domains with unified interface
- **High Performance**: Fast storage and retrieval operations
- **Quality Focus**: Only high-value insights (business_value >= 0.6) used in task execution
- **Integration Ready**: Seamless connection points for task executor and content analysis
- **Production Ready**: All tests pass with real workspace data

This implementation provides the foundation for AI agents to learn from actual business results and apply that knowledge to improve future task execution across different business domains.
