# OpenAI SDK Tools Integration

## Overview
This document describes the integration of OpenAI SDK tools into all agents in the AI Team Orchestrator system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `ai_agents/specialist.py`

#### Added WebSearchTool for All Agents
- **Location**: `_initialize_tools()` method
- **Change**: Added a new section that provides WebSearchTool to all agents when the SDK is available
- **Code**:
  ```python
  # ðŸ”§ OPENAI SDK TOOLS - Available to all agents
  if SDK_AVAILABLE:
      # Add WebSearchTool for all agents
      try:
          tools_list.append(WebSearchTool())
          logger.info(f"Agent {self.agent_data.name} equipped with OpenAI SDK WebSearchTool")
      except Exception as e:
          logger.warning(f"Could not add WebSearchTool to {self.agent_data.name}: {e}")
  ```

#### Updated Duplicate Prevention Logic
- **Location**: Tool configuration section in `_initialize_tools()`
- **Change**: Modified the web_search tool configuration to skip adding WebSearchTool if already added
- **Code**:
  ```python
  if tool_type == "web_search":
      # Skip - WebSearchTool already added for all agents above
      logger.debug(f"Agent {self.agent_data.name}: web_search already equipped via SDK.")
  ```

## Benefits

1. **Universal Web Search**: All agents now have access to web search capabilities without requiring explicit configuration
2. **Consistent Tool Access**: Ensures all agents have the same baseline capabilities
3. **SDK Integration**: Leverages the official OpenAI SDK tools when available
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to mock implementations when SDK is not available

## Future Enhancements

When additional SDK tools become available, they can be added in the same section:
- `CodeInterpreterTool` - For executing Python code
- `ImageGenerationTool` - For generating images
- Additional tools as released by OpenAI

## Implementation Details

### Tool Loading Flow
1. Common tools are loaded first (logging, health, progress reporting)
2. OpenAI SDK tools are added for all agents (currently WebSearchTool)
3. Workspace memory tools are added
4. Role-specific tools are added (PM tools for managers, handoff tools for specialists)
5. Database-configured tools are added (with duplicate prevention)

### SDK Availability
- The system checks for `SDK_AVAILABLE` flag to determine if OpenAI SDK is present
- Falls back to `openai_agents` or mock implementations if the primary SDK is not available
- Logs appropriate messages for debugging

## Testing
To verify the integration:
1. Check agent initialization logs for "equipped with OpenAI SDK WebSearchTool" messages
2. Verify that agents can use web search in their task execution
3. Ensure no duplicate WebSearchTool instances are created
