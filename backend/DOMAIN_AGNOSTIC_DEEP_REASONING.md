# Domain-Agnostic Deep Reasoning System

## üéØ Overview

Our enhanced reasoning system provides o3/Claude-style deep thinking while maintaining complete domain independence. The system analyzes any workspace using universal concepts that apply across all business domains.

## üîç Key Principles

### 1. **Universal Metrics**
Instead of domain-specific metrics, we use universal concepts:
- **Resource Utilization** (not "developer productivity")
- **Goal Progress** (not "sales targets")
- **Quality Scores** (not "code quality")
- **Efficiency Ratios** (not "conversion rates")

### 2. **Context-Driven Analysis**
The system adapts to any domain by reading from workspace context:
```python
workspace_data = context.get('workspace_data', {})
domain = workspace_data.get('domain', 'general')
```

### 3. **Multi-Perspective Evaluation**
Universal perspectives that apply everywhere:
- **Resource Efficiency** - How well are resources being used?
- **Goal Alignment** - Are we progressing toward objectives?
- **Quality Focus** - Is output meeting standards?
- **Sustainability** - Can this pace/approach continue long-term?

## üß† Deep Reasoning Steps

### Step 1: Problem Decomposition
Breaks down any query into universal components:
- Resource modifications
- Status assessments
- Optimization opportunities
- Goal alignment checks

### Step 2: Multi-Perspective Analysis
Evaluates from stakeholder-agnostic viewpoints:
- Current utilization metrics
- Goal completion averages
- Quality indicators
- Long-term sustainability

### Step 3: Alternative Generation
Creates options based on universal patterns:
- Immediate action
- Monitored waiting
- Phased approach

### Step 4: Deep Evaluation
Scores alternatives using domain-agnostic criteria:
- Feasibility
- Impact
- Cost efficiency
- Timeline
- Risk level

### Step 5: Self-Critique
Identifies universal biases:
- Status quo bias
- Recency bias
- Optimism bias
- Data availability bias

### Step 6: Confidence Calibration
Assesses certainty based on:
- Data quality
- Analysis completeness
- Unknown factors
- Historical patterns

## üìä Example Flow

**User Query**: "Should we add a resource to the team?"

**Domain-Agnostic Analysis**:
```
1. Current resource count: 3
2. Active work items: 1
3. Utilization rate: 33%
4. Goal progress: 45%
5. Quality score: 85%

Alternatives evaluated:
- Add now (confidence: 70%)
- Wait 2-4 weeks (confidence: 85%)
- Flexible resource (confidence: 75%)

Recommendation: Wait and monitor
Confidence: 72% (moderate-high)
```

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Works for ANY domain** - Sales, engineering, marketing, operations
2. **No hardcoded assumptions** - Adapts to workspace context
3. **Scalable reasoning** - Same logic works for 2 or 200 resources
4. **Transparent process** - Users see universal concepts they understand
5. **Consistent quality** - Same deep analysis regardless of domain

## üîß Configuration

Enable in `.env`:
```bash
ENABLE_DEEP_REASONING=true
DEEP_REASONING_THRESHOLD=0.7
REASONING_CONFIDENCE_MIN=0.6
MAX_REASONING_ALTERNATIVES=3
```

## üéØ Integration Points

1. **Conversational AI** - Triggered for strategic decisions
2. **Goal System** - Evaluates goal achievement paths
3. **Quality Assurance** - Provides reasoning for quality scores
4. **Director Agent** - Uses for team composition decisions

The system maintains our core principle: **One codebase, infinite possibilities**.
