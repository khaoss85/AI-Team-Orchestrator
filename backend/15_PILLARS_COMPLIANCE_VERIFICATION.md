## Detailed Pillar-by-Pillar Verification

### ✅ Pillar 1: Goal Decomposition
**Status: FULLY COMPLIANT**

**Evidence:**
- Goal decomposition functionality remains unchanged in AI agents
- Caching applied ONLY to read operations (`_get_workspace_context()` cached with 5min TTL)
- AI decomposition logic in `manager.py` and `specialist.py` untouched by optimizations
- Cache invalidation on workspace updates ensures fresh data for decomposition

**Implementation Details:**
```python
@cached(ttl=300)  # Cache for 5 minutes - saves 6-8 DB calls per request
async def _get_workspace_context(workspace_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Context fetching logic remains unchanged
