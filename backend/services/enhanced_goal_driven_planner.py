        You are an expert project manager and task decomposition specialist.

        - Current Progress: {goal.current_value}
        - Status: {goal.status}
        - Workspace ID: {goal.workspace_id}
        
        ASSET REQUIREMENT TO FULFILL:
        - Asset Name: {requirement.asset_name}
        - Asset Type: {requirement.asset_type}
        - Asset Format: {requirement.asset_format}
        - Description: {requirement.description}

        - Priority: {requirement.priority}

        ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
        {json.dumps(requirement.acceptance_criteria, indent=2)}
        
        TASK GENERATION OBJECTIVES:
        1. CONCRETE DELIVERABLES: Each task must produce a specific, measurable output
        2. ASSET-FOCUSED: Tasks must directly contribute to creating the required asset
        3. ACTIONABLE: Tasks must be immediately executable by available agents
        4. SEQUENCED: Tasks should build logically toward the final deliverable
        5. QUALITY-DRIVEN: Include quality validation and review steps
        
        TASK DECOMPOSITION PRINCIPLES:
        - Break the asset creation into 2-5 specific, executable tasks
        - Each task should take 1-4 hours of focused work
        - Include research, creation, and validation phases
        - Ensure tasks are concrete (not abstract or planning-only)
        - Focus on immediate actions that produce tangible outputs
        
        AGENT SKILL CONSIDERATIONS:
        Generate tasks that can be executed by AI agents with these typical capabilities:
        - Research and data collection
        - Content creation and writing
        - Analysis and synthesis
        - Tool usage and automation
        - Quality validation and review

        CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
        - Each task must have a CONCRETE OUTPUT (not abstract planning)
        - Tasks must DIRECTLY CREATE the required asset components
        - Include quality validation at appropriate points
        - Ensure logical sequencing and dependencies
        - Focus on ACTIONABLE WORK that produces business value
        - Tasks should be immediately executable by AI agents
