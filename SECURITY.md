- UI/UX issues without security impact

## üõ†Ô∏è **Security Best Practices for Users**

### **üîë API Key Management**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Use environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"

# ‚ùå Bad: Hard-code in files
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-key-here"  # Don't do this!
```

### **üö® Monitoring & Alerts**
```bash
# Monitor API usage and costs
curl localhost:8000/api/monitoring/costs

# Check for unusual agent activity
curl localhost:8000/api/monitoring/security-events
```

### **üîí Production Hardening**
- Use dedicated API keys for production
- Enable request logging for audit trails
- Set conservative API usage limits
- Regular security updates
- Monitor agent behavior patterns
