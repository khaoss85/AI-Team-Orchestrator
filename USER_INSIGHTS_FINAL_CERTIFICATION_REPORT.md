## 5. HARDCODED VALUES CHECK ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Frontend Findings
```
‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE:
- placeholder="" attributes in input fields (UI hints, not data)
- SelectValue placeholder for dropdown hints

‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR ISSUES (Non-blocking):
- 2 TODO comments in BulkActionsBar.tsx for future features
  - Line 135: Bulk flag as verified
  - Line 147: Bulk flag as important
```

### Backend Findings
```
‚úÖ CLEAN:
- No hardcoded URLs or credentials
- No test email addresses
- No lorem ipsum content
- Configuration properly externalized

‚ÑπÔ∏è INFORMATIONAL:
- Fake detection logic in holistic_task_deliverable_pipeline.py
  (This is GOOD - it detects and prevents placeholder content)
```

**Verdict: No critical hardcoded values found**

---

## 6. TEST COVERAGE ASSESSMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Current State
- **Integration Tests**: Found for content learning and insights
- **Unit Tests**: Basic coverage for core services
- **Frontend Tests**: Not found (typical for rapid prototyping)

### Recommendation for Production
```javascript
// Recommended test additions before production:
1. Frontend component tests (React Testing Library)
2. API endpoint integration tests
3. Database migration rollback tests
4. Load testing for bulk operations
5. Security tests for user permissions
```

**Verdict: Functional but would benefit from expanded test coverage**
