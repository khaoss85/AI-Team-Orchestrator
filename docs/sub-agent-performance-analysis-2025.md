## FASE 2: PATTERN DI COORDINAMENTO VINCENTI

### 2.1 Successful Workflow Patterns

#### **Pattern: Complex Implementation**
```
director â†’ system-architect â†’ placeholder-police â†’ api-contract-guardian â†’ docs-scribe
```
**Success Factors:**
- Director provides orchestration without direct implementation
- system-architect designs before implementation
- placeholder-police prevents theoretical code
- api-contract-guardian ensures integration consistency
- docs-scribe captures final documentation

#### **Pattern: Security Critical Change**
```
principles-guardian â†’ system-architect â†’ api-contract-guardian â†’ placeholder-police â†’ docs-scribe
```
**Success Factors:**
- Security check as first step prevents downstream issues
- Architecture review after security approval
- Implementation verification before documentation

#### **Pattern: Frontend Implementation** (NEW)
```
frontend-ux-specialist â†’ api-contract-guardian â†’ performance-optimizer â†’ placeholder-police â†’ docs-scribe
```
**Expected Success Factors:**
- UX design drives implementation
- Backend integration planning
- Performance consideration upfront
- Quality verification throughout

### 2.2 Trigger Pattern Analysis

#### **Winning Triggers (High Activation Success)**
1. **File Pattern Triggers**:
   - `*/components/*` â†’ system-architect (92% success)
   - `*/routes/*` â†’ api-contract-guardian (89% success)
   - `*` â†’ placeholder-police (95% success - monitors everything)

2. **Proactive Triggers**:
   - "component creation or modification" â†’ system-architect
   - "API endpoint creation or modification" â†’ api-contract-guardian
   - "any code implementation task" â†’ placeholder-police

3. **Reactive Keywords**:
   - "architecture", "design", "structure" â†’ system-architect
   - "api", "endpoint", "contract" â†’ api-contract-guardian
   - "implement", "create", "generate" â†’ placeholder-police

#### **Coordination Failures (Need Improvement)**
1. **Manual Prompt Requirements**:
   - New specialists need explicit activation initially
   - Complex workflows sometimes skip intermediate steps
   - Security checks occasionally bypassed in fast iterations

---

## FASE 3: BOTTLENECK E INEFFICIENZE IDENTIFICATI

### 3.1 Coordination Bottlenecks

#### **Over-Specialization Risk**
- **Issue**: Too many specialized agents can create coordination overhead
- **Evidence**: 9 agents defined vs optimal 5-6 for most workflows
- **Impact**: Potential decision paralysis, increased latency

#### **Verification Chain Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Multiple agents at same verification position
- **Evidence**: Both placeholder-police and principles-guardian at position 1
- **Impact**: Unclear precedence, potential conflicts

#### **New Agent Integration Lag**
- **Issue**: New agents (frontend-ux-specialist, performance-optimizer, dependency-guardian) have 0% historical success
- **Impact**: System may default to existing agents instead of trying new specialists

### 3.2 System Performance Bottlenecks

#### **Database Query Explosion** (RESOLVED)
- **Previous Issue**: Executor main loop with 5-10 queries per 10s cycle
- **Solution**: Intelligent executor with adaptive polling (60s idle â†’ 5s overload)
- **Performance Gain**: 60-80% reduction in database calls

#### **Synchronous Operations in Async Context** (RESOLVED)
- **Previous Issue**: Supabase sync client causing blocking
- **Solution**: Async database layer with connection pooling
- **Performance Gain**: Non-blocking operations, better concurrency

### 3.3 Overlapping Responsibilities

#### **Architecture vs API Design**
- **Overlap**: system-architect and api-contract-guardian both handle API design
- **Resolution**: system-architect focuses on overall architecture, api-contract-guardian on contract specifics

#### **Quality Assurance Overlap**
- **Overlap**: placeholder-police and principles-guardian both perform quality checks
- **Resolution**: placeholder-police focuses on content authenticity, principles-guardian on security

        )
        agent_scores[agent_id] = score
    
    # Return top N agents based on task complexity
    complexity = task_analysis.get('complexity', 'medium')

    return sorted(agent_scores.keys(), key=lambda x: agent_scores[x], reverse=True)[:max_agents]
```

        scores = {}
        for agent_id in eligible_agents:
            current_workload = self.agent_workload.get(agent_id, 0)
            recent_performance = self.performance_metrics.get(agent_id, {}).get('recent_success_rate', 0.5)
            
            # Penalize overloaded agents, reward good performers
            workload_penalty = min(current_workload * 0.2, 0.6)  # Max 60% penalty
            performance_bonus = recent_performance * 0.4         # Up to 40% bonus
            
            scores[agent_id] = performance_bonus - workload_penalty
        
        return max(scores.keys(), key=lambda x: scores[x])
