"""
Verification script to confirm that the agent assignment fix is working correctly.
This test verifies the three main issues that were identified and fixed:

1. ✅ Import errors with 'backend.' prefix - FIXED
2. ✅ Tasks stuck in 'in_progress' due to no agent assignment - FIXED  
3. ✅ Agent assignment logic updated to work with agents in 'busy' status - FIXED
