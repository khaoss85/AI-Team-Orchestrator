# Progress Indicator Test Guide

## Testing the Enhanced Configure Page

### What was added:

1. **ProgressIndicator component integration**: Added the existing `ProgressIndicator` component from `/src/components/ui/ProgressIndicator.tsx` to the configure page.

2. **Progress simulation logic**: Added a `simulateProgress()` function that simulates the goal analysis process with realistic steps:
   - Analyzing project objective (10%)
   - Extracting key metrics (25%)
   - Identifying strategic deliverables (45%)
   - Deep requirements analysis (65%)
   - Creating detailed plan (80%)
   - Risk analysis and finalization (95%)
   - Analysis completed (100%)

3. **Integration points**: The progress indicator shows:
   - During initial goal preview loading (when workspace has a goal and goals haven't been confirmed yet)
   - During goal reprocessing (when user clicks "Reprocess Goals")

### Files modified:

1. **Main file**: `/frontend/src/app/projects/[id]/configure/page.tsx`
   - Added ProgressIndicator import
   - Added progress state management
   - Added progress simulation logic
   - Added UI section to display progress indicator
   - Updated reprocess goals handler

2. **Existing file used**: `/frontend/src/components/ui/ProgressIndicator.tsx` (unchanged)

### Testing steps:

1. **Navigate to configure page**: Go to `/projects/[id]/configure` for any workspace
2. **Observe goal analysis**: When the page loads and starts analyzing goals, you should see:
   - "Analisi AI degli Obiettivi" section
   - Progress bar with animated progress updates
   - Status messages in Italian
   - Appropriate emoji icons for each step
3. **Test reprocessing**: Click "Reprocess Goals" button to see the progress indicator again

### Expected behavior:

- Progress bar updates smoothly every 800ms
- Status messages change with each step
- Icons change based on the analysis phase
- Progress completes at 100% with "Analisi completata!" message
- After completion, the GoalConfirmation component should appear

### Key features:

- **Realistic progress simulation**: 7 steps that mirror actual AI analysis phases
- **Localized content**: All messages in Italian to match the existing UI
- **Smooth animations**: Progress bar uses CSS transitions
- **Contextual icons**: Different emojis for different analysis phases
- **User feedback**: Clear messaging about what's happening and why it takes time
