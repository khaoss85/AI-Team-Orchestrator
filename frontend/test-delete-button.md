# DELETE Button Fix Summary

## Issue
The DELETE button in the project settings page was broken due to a prop mismatch between the ConfirmModal component and how it was being used.

## Root Cause
The settings page was passing props that the ConfirmModal component didn't support:
- `onClose` instead of `onCancel`
- `confirmButtonClass` (not supported)
- `loading` (not supported)

## Fix Applied
Updated the ConfirmModal component to support both the old and new prop patterns:

1. Made `cancelText` optional with default value "Cancel"
2. Added support for both `onCancel` and `onClose` props
3. Added `confirmButtonClass` prop for custom button styling
4. Added `loading` prop with spinner animation
5. Disabled buttons when loading is true

## Changes Made
- `/src/components/ConfirmModal.tsx`: Updated to support additional props and loading state

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Navigate to any project's settings page: `/projects/[id]/settings`
2. Scroll to the bottom "Danger Zone" section
3. Click "Delete Project" button
4. Confirm the modal appears correctly
5. Click "Delete Project" in the modal
6. Verify the loading spinner appears
7. Verify successful deletion and redirect to projects list

## Backend Verification
The backend DELETE endpoint at `/workspaces/{workspace_id}` is working correctly:
- Returns 404 for non-existent workspaces
- Successfully deletes existing workspaces with cascade deletion
- Cleans up human feedback requests before deletion
